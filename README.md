# DamageTracker
I wanted to set up a for the video game Terraria(https://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/Terraria/) that would track the players total damage done to any NPC in a multiplayer envrionment. 
Unfortunately, I found out the engine doesn't report the damage a player does to enemies through through debuffs, making it impossible to tell which player was the one to actually apply some percent of damage in a multiplayer setting.
