1. bind an interface to a button for the dmg tracking
1.1 let ppl reset damage in the interface
1.2 auto reset when a new boss spawns/dies (make this toggleable)
2. track each persons dmg individually BY FORCE (dont want people to have to opt in cuz thats annoying to do)
3. track events and bosses, anything with a health bar
4. have a list of monsters that spawn from each boss, cuz you'd want to track dmg done to minions/spawns from the boss, and not other mobs
5. have global a key:value thing of players : total damage
5.1 have a per-boss key:value thing of players : damage to boss
